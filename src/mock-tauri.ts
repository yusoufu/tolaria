## Wiki-Links
See [[Stock Screener — EMA200 Wick Bounce]] for the experiment approach.
Contact [[Matteo Cellini]] for sponsorship data.
Link to [[Grow Newsletter]] responsibility.
Check [[Software Development]] for tech notes.
See [[Laputa App Design Session]] event recap.
Read [[Write Weekly Essays]] procedure.
Also see [[Non-Existent Note]] which is a broken link.

## Paragraphs & Spacing
This is a normal paragraph with enough text to test line wrapping and spacing between elements. The paragraph should have comfortable line height and spacing from the heading above.

And this is a second paragraph to verify inter-paragraph spacing is correct. Good typography requires consistent vertical rhythm throughout the document.

# Grow Newsletter

## Purpose
Build a sustainable audience through high-quality weekly essays on **engineering leadership**, **AI**, and **personal systems**.

## Key Metrics
- Subscriber count (target: 100k by Q2 2026)
- Open rate (target: > 50%)
- Click-through rate

## Current Strategy
1. Publish one essay per week — Tuesday morning
2. Promote via Twitter/X threads
3. Cross-post to LinkedIn with native formatting
4. Guest posts on other newsletters monthly

## Procedures
- [[Write Weekly Essays]] — the core writing workflow
- Monthly audience analysis and topic planning

## Notes
The newsletter is the *engine* that drives everything else — sponsorships, consulting leads, and brand building.

# Write Weekly Essays

## Schedule
- **Monday**: Pick topic, outline
- **Tuesday**: First draft
- **Wednesday**: Edit and polish
- **Thursday**: Schedule for Tuesday send

## Writing Guidelines
- 1500-2500 words
- One clear takeaway
- Use *real examples* from personal experience
- Include actionable advice, not just theory

### Checklist
- [ ] Pick a topic from the backlog
- [ ] Write outline with 3-5 sections
- [x] Set up newsletter template
- [x] Configure email scheduling
- [ ] Review analytics from last issue

### Nested Topics
- Content strategy for growing the newsletter audience through organic channels, referrals, and high-quality evergreen content that people want to share with their engineering teams
  - Newsletter growth and subscriber acquisition including all the different channels we use to attract new readers to the publication
    - Organic subscribers from search, Twitter, and word of mouth — these are the highest quality subscribers with the best retention rates over time
    - Paid acquisition through Facebook ads and newsletter cross-promotions with other engineering publications in the space
  - Social media cross-posting
- Technical writing
  - Code examples
  - Architecture diagrams
1. First ordered item with a really long description that should definitely wrap to the next line when displayed in the editor, testing the hanging indent behavior for numbered lists
2. Second ordered item — shorter
  1. Nested ordered item that also has quite a long description to verify that the indentation works correctly for nested numbered lists too

# Stock Screener — EMA200 Wick Bounce

## Hypothesis
Stocks that wick below the 200-day EMA and close above it show a **statistically significant bounce** in the following 5-10 days.

## Setup
- Scan for daily candles where:
  - Low < EMA200
  - Close > EMA200
  - Volume > 1.5x average
- Filter for mid-cap stocks ($2B-$20B)

## Results So Far
| Date | Ticker | Entry | Exit | Return |
|------|--------|-------|------|--------|
| 2026-01-15 | AAPL | 182.30 | 189.50 | +3.9% |
| 2026-01-22 | MSFT | 410.20 | 418.80 | +2.1% |

## Next Steps
- [ ] Backtest on 10 years of data
- [ ] Add RSI filter for oversold confirmation
- [ ] Build automated alerts via Python script

# Facebook Ads Strategy

## Key Learnings
- **Lookalike audiences** from newsletter subscribers convert 3x better than interest-based targeting
- Video ads outperform static images by 40% on engagement
- Best performing CTA: "Join 50,000 engineers" (social proof)

## Budget
- Monthly budget: $2,000
- Cost per subscriber: ~$1.50 (down from $3.20 in Q3 2025)

## A/B Tests Running
1. Long-form vs short-form ad copy
2. Testimonial vs data-driven creative
