# Build Laputa App

## Text Formatting
This paragraph has **bold text**, *italic text*, ***bold italic***, ~~strikethrough~~, and \`inline code\`. Here's a [regular link](https://example.com) and a wiki-link to [[Matteo Cellini]].

## Headings

### Third Level Heading
Content under H3.

#### Fourth Level Heading
Content under H4.

## Lists

### Bullet Lists (Nested)
- First level item — this is a top-level bullet point
  - Second level item — indented one level
    - Third level item — indented two levels
    - Another third level item with longer text that wraps to multiple lines to test alignment
  - Back to second level
- Another first level item
  - With a nested child
- Final first level item

### Numbered Lists
1. Step one — do this first
2. Step two — then do this
3. Step three — finally this
   1. Sub-step 3a
   2. Sub-step 3b

### Checkboxes
- [x] Completed task with strikethrough
- [x] Another done item
- [ ] Pending task — needs attention
- [ ] Future task with **bold** text inside

### Mixed Nesting
- Top level bullet
  - Nested bullet
    - Deep nested bullet
  - Back to second
- Another top level
  - With child

## Block Quotes
> This is a blockquote. It should have a left border and distinct styling.
> It can span multiple lines and contain **formatting**.

## Code Blocks
\`\`\`typescript
interface VaultEntry {
  path: string;
  title: string;
  isA: string;
  status: string | null;
}

function loadVault(path: string): VaultEntry[] {
  // Load all markdown files from the vault
  return entries.filter(e => e.isA !== 'Note');
}

## Wiki-Links
See [[Stock Screener — EMA200 Wick Bounce]] for the experiment approach.
Contact [[Matteo Cellini]] for sponsorship data.
Link to [[Grow Newsletter]] responsibility.
Check [[Software Development]] for tech notes.
See [[Laputa App Design Session]] event recap.
Read [[Write Weekly Essays]] procedure.
Also see [[Non-Existent Note]] which is a broken link.

## Paragraphs & Spacing
This is a normal paragraph with enough text to test line wrapping and spacing between elements. The paragraph should have comfortable line height and spacing from the heading above.

And this is a second paragraph to verify inter-paragraph spacing is correct. Good typography requires consistent vertical rhythm throughout the document.

# Write Weekly Essays

## Schedule
- **Monday**: Pick topic, outline

### Checklist
- [ ] Pick a topic from the backlog
- [ ] Write outline with 3-5 sections
- [x] Set up newsletter template
- [x] Configure email scheduling
- [ ] Review analytics from last issue

### Nested Topics
- Content strategy for growing the newsletter audience through organic channels, referrals, and high-quality evergreen content that people want to share with their engineering teams
  - Newsletter growth and subscriber acquisition including all the different channels we use to attract new readers to the publication
    - Organic subscribers from search, Twitter, and word of mouth — these are the highest quality subscribers with the best retention rates over time
    - Paid acquisition through Facebook ads and newsletter cross-promotions with other engineering publications in the space
  - Social media cross-posting
- Technical writing
  - Code examples
  - Architecture diagrams
1. First ordered item with a really long description that should definitely wrap to the next line when displayed in the editor, testing the hanging indent behavior for numbered lists
2. Second ordered item — shorter
  1. Nested ordered item that also has quite a long description to verify that the indentation works correctly for nested numbered lists too

# Stock Screener — EMA200 Wick Bounce

## Hypothesis
Stocks that wick below the 200-day EMA and close above it show a **statistically significant bounce** in the following 5-10 days.

## Setup
- Scan for daily candles where:
  - Low < EMA200
  - Close > EMA200
  - Volume > 1.5x average
- Filter for mid-cap stocks ($2B-$20B)

## Results So Far
| Date | Ticker | Entry | Exit | Return |
|------|--------|-------|------|--------|
| 2026-01-15 | AAPL | 182.30 | 189.50 | +3.9% |
| 2026-01-22 | MSFT | 410.20 | 418.80 | +2.1% |

## Next Steps
- [ ] Backtest on 10 years of data
- [ ] Add RSI filter for oversold confirmation
- [ ] Build automated alerts via Python script

# Facebook Ads Strategy

## Key Learnings
- **Lookalike audiences** from newsletter subscribers convert 3x better than interest-based targeting
- Video ads outperform static images by 40% on engagement
- Best performing CTA: "Join 50,000 engineers" (social proof)

## Budget
- Monthly budget: $2,000
- Cost per subscriber: ~$1.50 (down from $3.20 in Q3 2025)

## A/B Tests Running
1. Long-form vs short-form ad copy
2. Testimonial vs data-driven creative
