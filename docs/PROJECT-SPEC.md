# Laputa App — Personal Knowledge & Life Management App

## Status: V1 Complete! 🎉

## Vision
Custom desktop + mobile app to manage Luca's life — projects, responsibilities, knowledge, people, events. Built around a specific ontology that no existing app gets right. The current Laputa vault (Obsidian, 9200+ markdown files) is the data layer and predecessor — the app gives it a proper UI.

## Tech Stack
- **Desktop**: Tauri (Rust shell + system webview)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Editor**: CodeMirror 6 — live preview with reveal-on-focus (Obsidian/Bear style)
- **Mobile**: Capacitor (wraps same web UI for iOS/Android) — later phase
- **Data**: plain markdown files on disk with YAML frontmatter, git-versioned
- **Core logic**: Rust (file parsing, git ops, indexing) via Tauri commands

## Ontology

### Core Entities

#### Year
- Top-level time container
- Has: Quarters, Targets
- Naming convention: `2026` (Laputa legacy: Chinese zodiac names like `2022-tiger`)

#### Quarter
- Time container within a Year
- Has: Projects, Targets
- Natural planning/review cycle

#### Responsibility
- Long-running duty, possibly indefinite
- Has clear and measurable KPIs (via Measures)
- Has an owner (Person)
- Has: Projects, Procedures, Tasks, Measures
- Examples: "Grow newsletter", "Manage sponsorships", "Stay healthy"

#### Measure
- A trackable metric tied to one or more Responsibilities
- Quantitative and observable
- Examples: "Resting heart rate", "Newsletter subscribers", "Monthly revenue", "Sponsorship close rate"

#### Target
- A time-bound goal for a Measure
- Typically quarterly
- Examples: "Resting HR < 55 by Q1 2026", "Reach 100k subscribers by Q2 2026"
- Belongs to: a Quarter (or Year), references a Measure

#### Project
- Has a beginning and an end
- Can't be completed in one sitting
- Has success criteria (key results, described informally in the project page)
- Has a timeline — at minimum a deadline (default: end of quarter)
- Advances one or more Responsibilities
- Has an owner (Person)
- Belongs to: Quarter (primary), Responsibility
- Has: Tasks, Notes

#### Experiment
- Like an unplanned baby project — exploring something promising without expectation of success
- Can't be completed in one sitting
- No strict success criteria or deadline
- Has an owner (Person)
- Examples: "Vibe-coding a stock screener", "Testing a new content format"

#### Procedure
- Recurring piece of work, completable in one sitting
- Has a cadence (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
- Belongs to: a Responsibility (usually) or a Project (less common)

## UI Design

### Design Reference
- Wireframes: `/Users/luca/OpenClaw/Laputa-app-design.pen`
- Inspiration: Bear Notes, Obsidian

### Core Principle: Type-Agnostic UI
Minimize custom UI behavior per entity type. Everything is a file, everything gets the same treatment. Type only determines which sidebar section an entity appears under (and maybe an icon/color hint). The editor, right panel, and note list behave identically regardless of type.

### Layout: Four Panels

#### 1. Left Sidebar — Navigation
**Filters** (flat, switch the note list view):
- All Notes
- Untagged
- Favorites
- People
- Events
- Trash

**Section Groups** (expandable, show entity list):
- PROJECTS +
- EXPERIMENTS +
- RESPONSIBILITIES +
- PROCEDURES +

**Topics** (flat list, not nested):
- work
- strategy
- ideas
- research
- drafts
- archive

#### 2. Note List — Middle Panel
- Contextual to sidebar selection
- Title, preview snippet, date, tags as colored pills
- Status/type indicators
- Search bar + create button
- Default sort: last edited (descending)
- Quick type filter pills: `All | Notes | Events | People | ...`
- When viewing a section group entity (e.g. a Project): its own page is **pinned at top**, children listed below

#### 3. Editor — Main Panel
- CodeMirror 6 with live preview (reveal markdown syntax on active line)
- **Tab bar** at top: multiple open notes, closeable, shows parent context
- Title + content only — NO properties/frontmatter shown in editor
- Tags shown as clickable pills below title
- Created/last edited dates below title
- Wikilinks rendered as clickable in-app navigation links
- Frontmatter exists in the file but is hidden from the editor view

#### 4. Right Panel — Inspector
- **Status** pills (Active, Draft, etc.)
- **Properties**: Created, Modified, Author, Word Count, custom properties. Editable — writes to YAML frontmatter.
- **Relationships**: all "belongs to", "related to", "advances" links. Editable.
- **Backlinks**: notes that reference this note
- **Revision History**: git commits for this file — hash, message, author, timestamp. "View all revisions" link.

### Key UI Decisions
- **Editor is sacred** — all metadata/relationships live in the right panel, not above the content. Avoids the Obsidian/Notion problem of properties pushing content down.
- **Everything is a file** — a Project, Responsibility, Topic are all just notes with a type. Clicking one in the sidebar shows its page pinned at top of note list, children below.
- **Topics are flat** — no nesting for v1
- **Saved views / smart filters** — future feature. Saved queries that live under any entity in the sidebar (e.g. "Evergreen 60+ days" under a Procedure). Not in v1.
- **Tasks stay on Todoist** — no task management in v1

## Design Decisions
- **Month/Week are NOT entities** — they're time-based views/filters, not containers. Monthly reviews are a Procedure.
- **Essays, Monday Ideas, Videos, Readings** = Notes (belonging to Responsibility/Project)
- **Movies, Restaurants, Hotels** = Notes attached to Topics
- **Key Results** = informal, embedded in Project pages (not a separate entity)
- **Owner** = single Person per entity (no multi-owner for now)
- **Type-agnostic UI** — minimize type-specific behavior, keep everything consistent
- **Metadata in right panel, not in editor** — frontmatter is hidden from the editor, rendered as editable UI in the inspector

## Dev Workflow

> Full process documented in **`dev-workflow` skill** (`~/.openclaw/skills/dev-workflow/SKILL.md`).
> Below: Laputa-specific details only.

- **Repo**: `~/Workspace/laputa-app/` + GitHub `LucaRonin/laputa-app`
- **Design file**: `~/OpenClaw/projects/Laputa-app-design.pen`
- **Mock layer**: `src/mock-tauri.ts` (realistic test data for browser/Playwright testing without Tauri)

### Laputa-Specific MCPs (for Claude Code)
- **Context7** — up-to-date docs for Tauri v2, CodeMirror 6, React
- **Pencil MCP** — reads the .pen design file

### Key Lesson from M1
M1 passed all tests but showed 0 notes — vault path wrong, error silently swallowed. This drove the mandatory verification workflow now captured in the dev-workflow skill.

## V1 Milestones

### M1: Scaffold & Shell ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Empty Tauri + React app that opens a window, reads a vault path, and lists files.
- [x] Init repo at `~/Workspace/laputa-app/`
- [x] Tauri v2 + React 19 + TypeScript + Vite 7 project setup
- [x] Configure Vitest (7 tests), Playwright (2 E2E tests), Rust tests (10 tests)
- [x] Rust backend: `list_vault` command — scans directory, parses YAML frontmatter via `gray_matter` crate
- [x] Rust backend: extracts type (Is A), aliases, Belongs to, Related to, Status, Owner, Cadence, title from H1
- [x] React: four-panel layout (Sidebar 250px, NoteList 300px, Editor flex, Inspector 280px), all resizable
- [x] Tauri mock layer for browser testing (`src/mock-tauri.ts`)
- [x] Screenshot verification via Playwright (`e2e/screenshot.spec.ts`)
- [ ] Push to GitHub (not yet done)

**Git log (5 commits):**
```
e72d66a Add Tauri mock layer for browser testing and visual verification workflow

```

### M2: Sidebar & Note List
**Goal:** Navigate the vault via sidebar, see filtered note lists.
- [ ] Sidebar: Filters section (All Notes, Favorites, Trash)
- [ ] Sidebar: Section Groups (Projects, Experiments, Responsibilities, Procedures) — populated from frontmatter `type:`
- [ ] Sidebar: Topics — flat list, populated from `Related to` topic links
- [ ] Note list: show title, preview snippet, date, type indicator
- [ ] Note list: sort by last modified (descending)
- [ ] Note list: search (full-text across vault)
- [ ] Note list: type filter pills (All | Notes | Events | People | ...)
- [ ] Clicking a section group entity: pin its page at top, show children below
- [ ] Filesystem watching: live reload when files change externally

### M3: Editor
**Goal:** Open and edit markdown files with CodeMirror 6 live preview.
- [ ] CodeMirror 6 integration with React
- [ ] Live preview: hide markdown syntax, reveal on active line (Obsidian/Bear style)
- [ ] Frontmatter hidden from editor view
- [ ] Tab bar: open multiple notes, close tabs, show parent context
- [ ] Wikilinks rendered as clickable links → navigate in-app
- [ ] Save: write markdown + YAML frontmatter to disk
- [ ] Auto-save (debounced)
- [ ] Basic markdown features: headings, bold/italic, lists, code blocks, links, images

### M4: Right Panel — Inspector
**Goal:** View and edit metadata, relationships, and git history.
- [ ] Properties panel: Created, Modified, Author, Word Count, Status, custom fields
- [ ] Properties editable → writes to YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Relationships panel: Belongs to, Related to, Advances — rendered as clickable links
- [ ] Relationships editable (add/remove)
- [ ] Backlinks: auto-computed from wikilinks across vault
- [ ] Git revision history: show commits for current file (hash, message, author, date)
- [ ] "View all revisions" link

### M5: File Operations & Polish
**Goal:** Create, rename, delete files. Polish for daily-driver use.
- [ ] Create new note (with type selector → sets `type:` and target folder)
- [ ] Rename file (updates filename + title)
- [ ] Delete → move to trash
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+N new, Cmd+S save, Cmd+P quick open/search)
- [ ] Quick open palette (Cmd+P) — fuzzy search across all files
- [ ] People and Events filters in sidebar
- [ ] Visual polish: match Bear-inspired design from .pen wireframes
- [ ] E2E tests with Playwright for core flows

## Open Questions
- [ ] Migration path from current Laputa vault (legacy cleanup, schema normalization)
- [ ] Multi-user or just Luca + AI agents?
- [ ] How does Brian (and other agents) interact with the data?
- [ ] Mobile: when to start the Capacitor layer?
- [ ] Year/Quarter navigation in sidebar — dedicated section or time-based filter?
- [ ] Home/dashboard view — what does it show?
