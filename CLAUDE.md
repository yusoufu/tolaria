# CLAUDE.md — Laputa App

## ⛔ BEFORE EVERY COMMIT — Non-negotiable checklist

Run all of these. If any fails, fix before committing. No exceptions.

```bash
pnpm lint && npx tsc --noEmit       # lint + types
pnpm test                           # unit tests
pnpm test:coverage                  # frontend ≥70% coverage
cargo test                          # Rust tests
cargo llvm-cov --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --no-clean --fail-under-lines 85
pre_commit_code_health_safeguard    # CodeScene ≥9.2 — if it fails, fix structurally (see below)
```

**CI is a safety net, not a discovery tool.** If CI catches something you didn't catch locally, that's a process failure. All these tools are available locally — use them while you code, not just at the end.

## ⛔ BEFORE FIRING laputa-task-done — QA on real vault

1. Acquire lockfile: `echo $$ > /tmp/laputa-qa.lock && trap "rm -f /tmp/laputa-qa.lock" EXIT`
2. Kill other instances: `pkill -x laputa 2>/dev/null || true; sleep 1`
3. Start app: `pnpm tauri dev` from worktree
4. Switch vault to `~/Laputa` (not demo)
5. Test the feature/fix with real mouse clicks (`cliclick`) on real notes
6. If task touches file save: verify `git -C ~/Laputa diff` shows changes
7. If QA fails → fix and re-run. Do NOT fire the signal until it passes.

Fire done signal only after QA passes:
```bash
rm -f /tmp/laputa-qa.lock
openclaw system event --text "laputa-task-done:<task_id>:<slug>" --mode now
```

## ⛔ CODE HEALTH — No shortcuts

If `pre_commit_code_health_safeguard` flags a file:
- **Understand why** — use `code_health_review` via CodeScene MCP
- Fix the structural problem (extract hooks, split components, reduce complexity)
- **Never** add a JSDoc comment, `#[allow(...)]`, `// eslint-disable`, or `as any` just to pass the gate
- It's fine to take longer. False quality is worse than no quality.

## Project

Tauri v2 + React + TypeScript desktop app. Reads a vault of markdown files with YAML frontmatter.

- **Spec**: `docs/PROJECT-SPEC.md`
- **Architecture**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Abstractions**: `docs/ABSTRACTIONS.md`
- **Wireframes**: `ui-design.pen`
- **Luca's vault**: `~/Laputa/` (~9200 markdown files)

## Tech Stack

- Desktop: Tauri v2 (Rust backend)
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + BlockNote editor
- Tests: Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E), `cargo test` (Rust)
- Package manager: pnpm

## Architecture

- `src-tauri/src/` — Rust backend (file I/O, git, frontmatter parsing)
- `src/` — React frontend
- `src/mock-tauri.ts` — Mock layer for browser/test env (silently swallows Tauri calls — **not a substitute for native app testing**)
- `src/types.ts` — Shared TypeScript types

## How to Work

- **Never develop on `main`** — always on `task/<slug>` branch
- **Commit every 20–30 min** — atomic commits, one concern per commit (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`)
- **Update docs/** when changing architecture, abstractions, or significant design
- **Test as you go** — write tests alongside code, not after

## Testing

- Unit tests must cover real business logic, not "component renders"
- Every bug fixed manually → add a regression test
- Every new feature → new tests for new behavior paths
- `pnpm test:coverage` and `cargo llvm-cov` must pass before committing

## Design File (every UI task)

Every task with UI changes needs a design file. Follow this process:

1. **Open `ui-design.pen` first** — study existing frames to understand the visual language, spacing, and component style before designing anything new.
2. **Design in light mode** — all existing designs use light mode. New frames must match. Never use dark mode for designs.
3. **Create `design/<slug>.pen`** for the new feature — additive only, NOT a copy of ui-design.pen.
4. **When merging to main** — merge your frames into `ui-design.pen` with proper layout:
   - Place frames in a logical area (group by feature area, not stacked on top of each other)
   - Leave at least 100px spacing between frames
   - **Delete `design/<slug>.pen`** after merging — the frames now live in `ui-design.pen`

```bash
mkdir -p design
# Study schema first:
node -e "const f=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('ui-design.pen','utf8')); console.log(JSON.stringify(f.children[0],null,2))"
# Start fresh:
echo '{"children":[],"variables":{}}' > design/<slug>.pen
```

## macOS / Tauri Gotchas

- `Option+N` on macOS → special chars (`¡`, `™`), not `key:'N'`. Use `e.code` or `Cmd+N`.
- Tauri menu accelerators: use `MenuItemBuilder::new(label).accelerator("CmdOrCtrl+1")` — decorative text in labels doesn't register shortcuts.
- `app.set_menu()` replaces the ENTIRE menu bar — include all submenus.

## QA Scripts

```bash
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/laputa-qa/scripts/focus-app.sh laputa
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/laputa-qa/scripts/screenshot.sh /tmp/out.png
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/laputa-qa/scripts/shortcut.sh "command" "s"
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/laputa-qa/scripts/click.sh 400 300   # logical coords
```

## Push Workflow (IMPORTANT — changed Feb 27, 2026)

**Push directly to main** — no PRs, no branches, no CI queue.

The pre-push hook runs all checks locally before the push goes through. This replaces remote CI.

```bash
# After QA passes and you're ready to ship:
git push origin main    # pre-push hook runs automatically
```

### ⛔ NEVER use --no-verify
```bash
# FORBIDDEN — will be caught and rejected:
git push --no-verify
git commit --no-verify   # also forbidden for pre-push bypass
```

The hook runs: tsc, Vite build, frontend tests, frontend coverage, Rust coverage, Clippy, rustfmt, CodeScene. Fix any failures before pushing — do not skip.

If a check fails, fix the issue and push again. The hook is the gate — not remote CI.
