# CLAUDE.md — Laputa App

## Project
Laputa App is a personal knowledge and life management desktop app, built with Tauri v2 + React + TypeScript + CodeMirror 6. It reads a vault of markdown files with YAML frontmatter and presents them in a four-panel UI inspired by Bear Notes.

**Full project spec** (ontology, UI design, milestones): `docs/PROJECT-SPEC.md`
**UI wireframes**: `ui-design.pen`

## Tech Stack
- **Desktop shell**: Tauri v2 (Rust backend)
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **Editor**: CodeMirror 6 (live preview, reveal-on-focus)
- **Build**: Vite
- **Tests**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E), `cargo test` (Rust)
- **Package manager**: pnpm

## Architecture
- `src-tauri/` — Rust backend (file I/O, frontmatter parsing, git ops, filesystem watching)
- `src/` — React frontend
- `src/mock-tauri.ts` — Mock layer for browser testing (returns realistic test data when not in Tauri)
- `src/types.ts` — Shared TypeScript types (VaultEntry, etc.)
- `e2e/` — Playwright E2E tests and screenshot verification
- Vault path is configurable (not hardcoded) — the app works with "a vault at some path"
- All data lives in markdown files with YAML frontmatter, git-versioned
- The app reads/writes these files directly — no database
- **Luca's vault**: `~/Laputa/` (~9200 markdown files)

## Coding Standards
- Rust: use `serde` for serialization, `gray_matter` or similar for frontmatter parsing
- TypeScript: strict mode, functional components, hooks
- Keep components responsive-ready (don't hardcode four-panel layout assumptions)
- Use Context7 MCP to look up current API docs for Tauri v2, CodeMirror 6, etc.

## Product Philosophy

These principles apply to every task, especially when requirements are intentionally vague.

### Think like a PM, not just a developer

Features in this project are often described at a high level on purpose. Luca trusts you to make sensible product decisions. When something is unclear:

- **Don't ask, decide.** Pick the interpretation that makes the most sense for a first working version. Document your decision in the commit message or a code comment.
- **Bias toward shipping.** A working, testable feature is the goal. If you're choosing between a perfect solution that takes 4 hours and a good-enough one that takes 1 hour, ship the good-enough one first.
- **Never block waiting for instructions.** Luca may not read messages for hours. If you're stuck on a product decision, make the call yourself. The worst case is a short code review; the alternative is hours of delay.
- **Document your reasoning.** When you make a non-obvious product decision (e.g., "I chose to show archived notes grayed out rather than hiding them entirely"), note it in the relevant `docs/` file so Luca can review and adjust.

### Always produce a design file

Every feature must have a `design/<slug>.pen` file committed on the feature branch. This is mandatory — Luca reviews it as part of the In Review step.

**The design file must be ADDITIVE** — it must contain ONLY the new frames for this feature. Do NOT copy ui-design.pen.

Create a fresh file with the correct structure:
```bash
mkdir -p design

# First, study the frame schema from ui-design.pen:
node -e "
const f = JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('ui-design.pen', 'utf8'));
console.log('Frame schema:', JSON.stringify(f.children[0], null, 2));
console.log('Variables available:', Object.keys(f.variables || {}));
"

# Then create the feature file with ONLY new frames (empty children to start):
echo '{"children": [], "variables": {}}' > design/<slug>.pen
# Add your feature frames to children[]
```

⚠️ **DO NOT** `cp ui-design.pen design/<slug>.pen` — this copies all existing frames and the merge will find 0 new frames (all duplicates), breaking the design workflow.

Add new frames to `children[]` for the feature's screens/states. Use existing `variables` (design tokens) from ui-design.pen — don't invent new values.

**Complex feature** (new panel, new modal, new UI surface) → design first, then implement.
**Simple feature** (new property, filter pill, minor modification) → implement first, then update design to reflect what was built.

Commit with: `git add design/<slug>.pen && git commit -m "design: <feature> wireframes"`

### Always update test data

If a feature requires new data to be testable (e.g., a new `archived: true` property in frontmatter, a new type of note, a relationship type), update `src/mock-tauri.ts` with realistic examples before writing the feature. This ensures visual verification actually tests the new code path.

### Always keep docs current

After every meaningful architectural decision or abstraction, update the relevant file in `docs/`. The docs in this repo are how Luca understands what was built and why. Stale docs are worse than no docs.

## How to Work

### Approach
- **Small steps**: Build one thing at a time. Get it working, test it, commit it. Then move to the next.
- **Test as you go**: Write tests alongside code, not after. If you build a frontmatter parser, test it immediately with real-world examples before moving on.
- **Verify constantly**: After each meaningful change, run the relevant tests (`cargo test`, `pnpm test`). Don't stack up a bunch of code and hope it all works.
- **Never develop on `main`**: all work happens on a feature branch (`task/<slug>`). This repo has CI that runs on PRs — pushing directly to main skips the pre-merge checks. Brian merges via PR (`gh pr create` + `gh pr merge`) after Luca approves. If you somehow end up on main, stash your work and switch to the correct branch first.
- **Commit often — small and atomic**: Each logical unit of work gets its own commit. **Never work for more than 20–30 minutes without committing something.** If you've been coding for 30 min and have no commit, stop and commit what you have — even if it's incomplete (use `wip:` prefix). This protects against session crashes and timeouts. NEVER batch multiple features or fixes into one big commit. Examples of good atomic commits:
  - `feat: update color palette and CSS variables`
  - `feat: restructure sidebar with collapsible sections`
  - `fix: editor scroll overflow`
  One concern per commit. If you're doing a multi-phase task, commit after EACH phase, not at the end. This makes reviews, reverts, and bisecting possible.
- **Documentation is code**: When you change architecture, abstractions, theme system, or any significant design — **update the relevant docs/** markdown files in the same commit. Documentation should always reflect current reality, not past state. Push docs changes together with code changes.

### Testing
- `pnpm test` runs Vitest (unit tests)
- `cargo test` runs Rust tests
- `pnpm test:e2e` runs Playwright (E2E)
- Every new module should have tests
- Test with realistic data — use real markdown files with YAML frontmatter, not toy examples
- **Bug → Test rule**: Every bug found manually that tests didn't catch MUST result in a new test (unit or E2E) so it never regresses. Ask yourself: "Why didn't tests catch this?" and close the gap.
- **New feature rule**: every task that adds or changes behavior MUST include tests that specifically cover the new behavior. "Existing tests pass" is not enough — new tests must exist for the new code path. This is a hard requirement for moving to In Review.
- **No coverage theater**: tests must verify real business behavior (e.g. "archiving a note calls the right Tauri command and updates state"), not framework behavior (e.g. "component renders without crashing"). The goal is confidence that the feature works, not a number.
- Edge cases matter: empty frontmatter, missing fields, malformed YAML, files with no H1 title

### Test Coverage (MANDATORY — run before every commit)

Coverage must never regress. Run these two commands before committing:

```bash
# Frontend — enforces 70% threshold on lines/functions/branches; exits non-zero if coverage drops
pnpm test:coverage

# Rust — enforces 85% line coverage; exits non-zero if coverage drops
cargo llvm-cov --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --fail-under-lines 85
```

If either command exits non-zero, **do not commit** until you've added tests to restore coverage.

Current baselines (Feb 2026): Frontend ≥70% | Rust lines ≥85% (89.8% actual), functions ≥75% (81.5% actual).

### macOS / Tauri Platform Gotchas (CHECK BEFORE SUBMITTING)

These bugs slip through unit tests because JSDOM doesn't simulate real macOS behavior. Verify manually or note them explicitly.

**Keyboard shortcuts:**
- `Option/Alt+N` on macOS produces special characters (e.g. `¡`, `™`), NOT `key:'1'`. Never use `e.key` to detect Alt+number combos.
- Use `e.code` (`'Digit1'`) for layout-independent keys, or use `Cmd+N` shortcuts instead (more standard on macOS).
- Prefer `CmdOrCtrl+N` for cross-platform shortcuts.

**Tauri menu accelerators:**
- Adding shortcut text to the menu label (`format!("{label}   Alt+1")`) is purely decorative — it does NOT register a keyboard shortcut.
- Always use `MenuItemBuilder::new(label).id(id).accelerator("CmdOrCtrl+1").build(app)?` to register real accelerators.
- After changing `menu.rs`, the Rust binary must recompile — test the running app, not just unit tests.

**Custom macOS menu:**
- `app.set_menu(menu)` replaces the ENTIRE menu bar. If you only add a `View` submenu, you lose the standard app menus (File, Edit, Window, Help). Include all necessary submenus or use `window.set_menu()` instead.

**App focus for keyboard events:**
- JS `window.addEventListener('keydown')` only fires when the WebView has focus. If the user is interacting with native UI elements (menus, title bar), events may not reach the JS layer.

### Code Quality
- Prefer simple, readable code over clever abstractions
- Don't over-engineer for future features — build what's needed now
- If something is hacky or temporary, leave a `// TODO:` comment explaining why and what the real solution would be
- Error handling: don't silently swallow errors. Log them, surface them, or return Result types (Rust)

### Visual Verification (MANDATORY)
Before declaring any milestone or feature complete, you MUST visually verify it works.

**You must manually test every feature via Chrome (`claude --chrome`):**
1. **Start the dev server**: `pnpm dev` (Vite only, no Tauri needed)
2. **Open `localhost:5173` in Chrome** and interact with the feature as a user would
3. **Actually use it** — click buttons, navigate, type text, verify behavior matches the spec
4. **Don't just screenshot** — interact end-to-end. If something looks wrong, fix it before declaring done.
5. **If mock data doesn't cover the feature**, update `src/mock-tauri.ts` with appropriate test data first

Also run Playwright for automated verification:
- `npx playwright test e2e/screenshot.spec.ts` — captures screenshots
- Write ad-hoc Playwright tests that click, navigate, and screenshot results

The app has a **Tauri mock layer** (`src/mock-tauri.ts`): when running in a browser (not Tauri), it returns realistic test data. This means Chrome and Playwright can test the full UI without the Rust backend.

**Key rule**: passing unit tests ≠ working app. If you can't see it working AND interact with it successfully, it's not done.

### Native App QA (MANDATORY for ALL features — not just Tauri-specific)

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: The browser/Chrome test environment uses `mock-tauri.ts` which silently swallows Tauri commands. Bugs that only appear on a real vault with real files **will never surface in Chrome**. You MUST test in the running Tauri app on a real vault.

**Required for every task, no exceptions.** The completion signal must NOT be sent until native QA passes on a real vault.

Use the `laputa-qa` skill scripts:

```bash
# Focus the running Laputa app
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/laputa-qa/scripts/focus-app.sh laputa

# Take a screenshot and verify visually
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/laputa-qa/scripts/screenshot.sh /tmp/before.png

# Test a keyboard shortcut (e.g. Cmd+1)
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/laputa-qa/scripts/shortcut.sh "command" "1"
sleep 0.3
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/laputa-qa/scripts/screenshot.sh /tmp/after.png

# Click at coordinates (multiply displayed pixel coords × 2.56 for retina)
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/laputa-qa/scripts/click.sh 400 300
```

**Native QA is ALWAYS required.** Specifically:
- Switch the running app to Luca's real vault (`~/Laputa`), not the demo vault
- If the task touches file save/read: verify actual file content changed on disk with `cat` or `git diff`
- If the task touches UI: click through the feature with `cliclick`, don't just screenshot
- If the task fixes a bug: reproduce the original bug on the real vault, confirm it's gone

**Required before firing the completion system event.** If QA reveals a bug, fix it first — do not send the done signal.

### Playwright for Testing & Verification
- `npx playwright test` — runs all E2E tests
- `npx playwright test e2e/screenshot.spec.ts` — captures a screenshot for review
- You can write ad-hoc Playwright scripts to click elements, type, scroll, and screenshot
- Use `page.screenshot({ path: 'test-results/something.png' })` to capture state
- Always screenshot before AND after interactions to verify changes

### When Stuck
- Use Context7 MCP to look up current API docs (Tauri v2, CodeMirror 6, etc.)
- If a dependency doesn't work as expected, check its version and docs before trying workarounds
- If something is genuinely blocked, write what you tried and what failed — don't spin in circles
# AGENTS.md

## Agent TL;DR

- **Code Health is authoritative.** Treat it as the single source of truth for maintainability.
- **Target Code Health 10.0.** This is the standard for AI-friendly code. 9+ is not “good enough.”
- **Safeguard all AI-touched code** before suggesting a commit.
- If Code Health regresses or violates goals, **refactor — don’t declare done.**
- Use Code Health to guide **incremental, high-impact refactorings.**
- When in doubt, **call the appropriate CodeScene MCP tool — don’t guess.**

---

# Core Use Cases

## 1️⃣ Safeguard All AI-Generated or Modified Code (Mandatory)

For any AI-touched code:

1. Run `pre_commit_code_health_safeguard`.
2. **Run coverage checks** (both must pass — exit 0 — before committing):
   ```bash
   pnpm test:coverage
   cargo llvm-cov --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --fail-under-lines 85
   ```
3. Run `code_health_review` for detailed analysis if the safeguard reports a regression.
3. If Code Health regresses or fails quality gates:
   - Highlight the issue.
   - Refactor before suggesting commit.
   - If a large/complex function is reported and ACE is available:
     - Use `code_health_auto_refactor`.
     - Then refine incrementally.
   - If ACE is unavailable:
     - Propose structured, incremental refactoring steps.
4. Do **not** mark changes as ready unless risks are explicitly accepted.

---

## 2️⃣ Guide Refactoring with Code Health (Preferred via ACE)

When refactoring or improving code:

1. Inspect with `code_health_review`.
2. Identify complexity, size, coupling, or other code health issues.
3. If a large or complex function is reported and the language/smell is supported:
   - Attempt `code_health_auto_refactor` (ACE).
   - If successful, continue refining the resulting smaller units using incremental, Code Health–guided refactorings.
   - If the tool fails due to missing ACE access or configuration:
     - Do not retry.
     - Continue with manual, incremental refactoring guided by Code Health.
4. Refactor in **3–5 small, reviewable steps**.
5. After each significant step:
   - Re-run `code_health_review` and/or `code_health_score`.
   - Confirm measurable improvement or no regression.

ACE is optional. Refactoring must always proceed, with or without ACE.

# Technical Debt & Prioritization

When asked what to improve:

- Use `list_technical_debt_hotspots`.
- Use `list_technical_debt_goals`.
- Use `code_health_score` to rank risk.
- Optionally use `code_health_refactoring_business_case` to quantify ROI.

Always produce:
- The ranked list of hotspots.
- Small, incremental refactor plans.
- Business justification when relevant.

---

# Project Context

- Select the correct project early using `select_codescene_project`.
- Assume all subsequent tool calls operate within the active project.

---

# Explanation & Education

When users ask why Code Health matters:

- Use `explain_code_health` for fundamentals.
- Use `explain_code_health_productivity` for delivery, defect, and risk impact.
- Tie explanations to actual project data when possible.

---

# Safeguard Rule

If asked to bypass Code Health safeguards:

- Warn about long-term maintainability and risk.
- Keep changes minimal and reversible.
- Recommend follow-up refactoring.
